Description: Implements partition-assisted clustering and multiple alignments of networks. It 1) utilizes partition-assisted clustering to find robust and accurate clusters and 2) discovers coherent relationships of clusters across multiple samples. It is particularly useful for analyzing single-cell data set. Please see Li et al. (2017) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005875> for detail method description.
